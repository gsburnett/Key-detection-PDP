There are 12 notes (C through B) and 12 major key signatures in Western music, with seven notes each.
A key signature can therefore be defined by the presence or absence of these 12 notes.
This neural network represents the psychological process of musical key recognition. 
After running the code, a graph is output which shows the match for each epoch.
The model updates until a match criterion of 125 is met.
